I was part of a team that developed a performance evalua on tool, designed and
executed in a way that helped the organiza on in recrui ng the best talent of
so􀁛ware engineers in the market. This was made possible by automa ng various
processes that allowed for effec ve data analysis and record management.
Previously, spreadsheets were used for this process.
